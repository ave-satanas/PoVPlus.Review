# EpicLoot

Version 0.15.4. Five integrations depend on its internals, more than any other mod, so an update is the highest-risk event for this pack. See [[OPS-revalidation#EpicLoot]].

- `0.15` removed `ShardStones.SocketsUI`, breaking UsefulTankards, TrollingFishing and SecondaryAttacks' binds. Their warnings are expected.
- Its `AutoStackItems` prefix always skips the original. `[code]`
- Generated configs such as `baseconfig\iteminfo.json` can differ in array order between machines. See [[INV-config-reconciliation]].
