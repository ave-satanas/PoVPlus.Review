# SeneaL UI

SeneaL UI 1.2.8 with SeneaL API 1.2.0. It moves the minimap under `SeneaLUI_Hud`, which breaks fixed-path consumers, and it provides `ContainerDocks`. Client-only layout entries in `seneaL.valheim.ui.cfg` appear after the UI runs, so that file differs from the server's in comments only. `[checked]`

Stale probes for PoV and EpicLoot are listed in [[INV-harmonyx-attribution]]. `Dual=False` is a stale probe result; belt and Wishbone both equip. `[runtime]` M16.
