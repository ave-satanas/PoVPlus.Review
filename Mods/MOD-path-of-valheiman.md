# Path of Valheiman

Version 5.3.6 (`treextr.pathofvalheiman`), the pack's core overhaul.

- `Creature density = 1.2` in its config scales spawn rows when a `SpawnSystem` wakes. `[checked]` See [[INV-config-reconciliation#Spawn reference]].
- It skips objects with missing prefabs, logging `Network object skipped`, and removes empty ObjectDB entries.
- World-settings lock: its load order leaves `EntryType` null, and ConfigManager's fallback binds. Server entries refused edits, even for an admin. `[runtime]` M16. The server-side difficulty RPC path is `[code]` only.
