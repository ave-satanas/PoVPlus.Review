# Build and release

## Source control

`patches\PoVPlus.Compat` is its own git repository, pushed to private `github.com/ave-satanas/PoVPlus.Compat`. DLLs and zips are ignored there, so `patches\dist\` stays the home of release artifacts. `gh` is not installed on this machine; Git Credential Manager holds the GitHub login.

## Build

```powershell
dotnet build patches\PoVPlus.Compat\PoVPlus.Compat.csproj -c Release -o .sandbox\build\compat -p:BaseIntermediateOutputPath=S:\Documents\ChatGPT\PoVPlusPlus\.cache\obj\compat\
```

Run from the workspace root. Stop on a failed build: a stale DLL has been tested by mistake here before.

## Package

```powershell
Copy-Item .sandbox\build\compat\PoVPlus.Compat.dll patches\dist\ -Force
python patches\PoVPlus.Compat\pack.py
```

`pack.py` follows the Hexium rules in the user's earlier tools: manifest fields, name format, 256-character description, version, 256×256 icon, every file at the zip root. It writes `patches\dist\PoVPlus_Compat-<version>.zip`. Update `SHA256SUMS.txt` after packing. Hexium accepts each version once. **Nothing has been uploaded.** Rules came from that tool, not Hexium's live site.

Raise `version_number` in `package\manifest.json` and `Version` in `Plugin.cs` together, and update `package\CHANGELOG.md`.

## Canonical artifacts

| File | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| Tested source | `eed8d74` of `PoVPlus.Compat`, by managed image match, not byte identity, M39 |
| Managed image digest | `F2B5F7F0ECC30338D23C091EBFC1ADC4106119FC8470324C4154F4F02016CC29`, from `tools/il-digest.ps1` |
| `patches\dist\PoVPlus.Compat.dll` 1.0.1 | `8b766887e53a9fd285d68df4150fe153c8e3831ba07e57ffab0bf4ca487a75eb` |
| `patches\dist\PoVPlus_Compat-1.0.1.zip` | `77419c0891888222c794938e2710d172107b5c187a9d91adf4c7b6d2fd2159c1` |

Superseded 1.0.0 package: `patches\archived\PoVPlus_Compat-1.0.0.zip`, zip `ac0b485e…c5da`, DLL `51956f65…b27b`.

`[checked]` from `SHA256SUMS.txt` on 2026-11-01. Do not copy these elsewhere; link here.

Gale holds this release as a local import, so a change of DLL also needs a new import. See [[OPS-gale-profile]].

Dependencies in the manifest: only `denikson-BepInExPack_Valheim-5.4.2360`, because each integration is optional. A mod manager install will not pull in the mods listed in [[MOD-inventory]].

Icon, empty `website_url` and license attribution are placeholders chosen by the agent.

## Fresh clone

`[runtime]` M34. A clone of `PoVPlus.Compat` at `eed8d74` built with 0 errors on this machine, then packaged once the DLL was copied to `../dist/`, a step the README lacked until the next commit. All 124 method bodies matched the release. The file hash differed, `62F3E78B…` against `8B766887…`, because the build path and module ID differ. So a hash match proves a shipped file, and a mismatch from another path does not prove different code. Building needs the installed pack, so it was not tested on a machine without one.

`[runtime]` M39 corrects that comparison. Method-body hashes omit strings, signatures, attributes and exception handlers, and that clone's version string carried the git commit, so its managed image did differ. Build with `-p:IncludeSourceRevisionInInformationalVersion=false` and compare Image SHA-256.

## Release maintenance

After any change to a report, release file or version, before committing in `Knowledge`:

1. Update `ENTRIES` in `tools/make_evidence_bundle.py` if the results files changed, such as a new acceptance folder.
2. Run `python Knowledge/tools/make_evidence_bundle.py --check`, review what changed, then regenerate without the flag. Redaction terms are in the untracked `tools\bundle-redactions.local` on the original machine.
3. Run `python Knowledge/tools/validate.py`. A stale bundle is an error when the workspace is present.

`Knowledge/.git/hooks/pre-commit` runs that validation and blocks the commit. Hooks are not versioned, so a new clone needs it added: `python tools/validate.py` as the hook body. The bundle is a sanitized snapshot, never the release itself.
