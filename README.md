> **Review snapshot.** Exported from internal commit `e8e63779b5ceb722476a366d3086603abf72accd`, as a single commit without its history. Records naming `PoVPlus.Knowledge` refer to that internal archive, which reviewers do not need. The conclusions here are claims to assess, not an approved result.

# PoVPlus knowledge base

Engineering records and an audit package for PoVPlus.Compat. **PoVPlus** is a personal Valheim mod pack of 87 mods built around Path of Valheiman. **PoVPlus.Compat** is a custom BepInEx plugin that fixes specific conflicts in that pack.

This repository holds records, not the plugin. It does not show that the whole pack is compatible.

## What the evidence concerns

| Item | Value | How it is known |
|---|---|---|
| Release | PoVPlus.Compat 1.0.1 | Tested and deployed. Not uploaded anywhere |
| Tested DLL SHA-256 | `8b766887e53a9fd285d68df4150fe153c8e3831ba07e57ffab0bf4ca487a75eb` | Hashed from deployed files. Exact bytes in [`EvidenceBundle/release/`](EvidenceBundle/release/PoVPlus.Compat.dll) |
| Release zip SHA-256 | `77419c0891888222c794938e2710d172107b5c187a9d91adf4c7b6d2fd2159c1` | [`EvidenceBundle/release/SHA256SUMS.txt`](EvidenceBundle/release/SHA256SUMS.txt) |
| Source commit | [`eed8d74`](https://github.com/ave-satanas/PoVPlus.Compat/tree/eed8d74b3700a044eb9dbce7053fe0ec2018ca69) | See below |
| IL digest of tested DLL | `1DC63390417AF3FA3B0626A8DBE6BFDA221EE0CB70BB65AAC29195374B20DF1D`, 124 method bodies, 37 types | From `tools/il-digest.ps1` in the source repository |

**Source relationship:** the DLL was built from the working tree on 2026-11-01, and the git repository was created afterwards. `eed8d74` is that source: a clone of it built to identical method bodies and types, with source text identical after line endings (M34). The file hash differs, because the build path and module ID are embedded. So the link is proven at the level of IL, not by byte-identical rebuild.

## Kinds of claim

Records tag claims beside the claim. Full rules: [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md).

| Tag | Means | Reviewer can check it? |
|---|---|---|
| `[checked]` | Files or source read directly, on the note's date | Partly; many read files were on the original machine |
| `[runtime]` | Observed in a run, cited by id such as M31 | Summary here; raw logs are local only |
| `[code]` | Concluded from reading code, not seen running | Yes, with the same mod versions |
| `[upstream]` | A mod author's statement | Not tested here |
| `[decision]` | Chosen by the project owner | Not a technical claim |
| `[hypothesis]`, `[unknown]` | Unproven, or an accepted gap | Open |

## Sanitized or unavailable

- [`EvidenceBundle/`](EvidenceBundle/README.md) is a **sanitized snapshot, not raw evidence**.
- Tested client configuration: a frozen, redacted subset in `EvidenceBundle/config-1.0.1/`. See its [README](EvidenceBundle/README.md).
- Not available: raw logs, saves, screenshots, game files and third-party mods.
- `evidence\`, `backups\` and drive-letter paths in notes are provenance from the original machine, and are not links. List them with `python tools/validate.py --external`.

## Checks

From the root of a clean clone, with Python 3 and nothing else:

```
python tools/validate.py
python tools/make_evidence_bundle.py --verify
```

These check structure and hashes only. Passing does not show that any claim is true.
