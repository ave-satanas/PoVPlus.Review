# ServerManager Control+Click

**Status:** **deferred, not implemented, not blocking.** `[decision]` ServerManager's decompiled code had no control-key or editor handling when searched on 2026-10-31. `[checked]`

**Requested behaviour:**
- Click connects normally.
- Alt+Click opens the local menu.
- Control+Click opens a dialog to edit and persist the client's configured server.
- Save affects the next connection. Cancel preserves the old destination.
- Alt takes precedence if both are held.
