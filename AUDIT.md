# Audit guide

For an independent reviewer. The aim is to let you challenge these conclusions, so treat them as claims to test, including any written by the original agent.

## Scope

**Audited:** PoVPlus.Compat 1.0.1, the config changes around it, and the evidence for them.

**Not claimed:** that the pack is fully compatible. Most mod interactions were never examined. See [coverage](Compatibility/CMP-coverage.md). In the server's patch map, 598 methods are patched by two or more owners; only a handful of interactions were studied deeply.

**Architecture:** one BepInEx plugin, GUID `0.povplus.compat`, with nine modules, each with its own Harmony owner and guards. `Awake` installs lookups; the rest install just before FeedLikeGrandma and FineDining's `Start`. See [architecture](Systems/SYS-compat-architecture.md).

## Reading order

1. [README.md](README.md) for the artifact and source relationship.
2. This file's claim table.
3. [Corrections](Investigations/INV-corrections.md). Earlier conclusions were wrong often enough that this is a fair measure of reliability.
4. [Source at the tested commit](https://github.com/ave-satanas/PoVPlus.Compat/tree/eed8d74b3700a044eb9dbce7053fe0ec2018ca69), with [module records](Compatibility/CMP-index.md).
5. [Evidence record](EvidenceBundle/reports/EVIDENCE.md) for the ids below.
6. [Evidence bundle](EvidenceBundle/README.md) for what is and is not available.

## Release, source and evidence

| Link | Status |
|---|---|
| Source → DLL | Proven by IL, not by byte identity. See [README](README.md#what-the-evidence-concerns) |
| DLL → deployment | Hashes matched on client, server and allow-list. `[checked]` on the original machine |
| Deployment → runtime evidence | M31, M32 and M37 ran 1.0.1. **Most feature evidence predates it.** See below |
| Pack → reviewer | Every package, version, DLL hash and parity result in `EvidenceBundle/results/pack-inventory.tsv`. See [Gale profile](Operations/OPS-gale-profile.md). The mods themselves are not included |
| DLL → reviewer | Exact tested bytes in `EvidenceBundle/release/`. Hash it yourself and compare with the README |
| Configuration → reviewer | Frozen client subset in `EvidenceBundle/config-1.0.1/`, taken after acceptance. Not the complete profile, and not the server copy |
| Evidence → this repository | Sanitized copies and filtered excerpts; originals are local only |

**Which build each result used:** M16 and M17, the consolidated feature matrix, ran on builds before 1.0.1. 1.0.1 added `CuisineConversions.cs` and one line in `Plugin.cs`, leaving the other modules' source unchanged. Rerun on 1.0.1 itself: startup, join, rejoin, save, shutdown, FineDining rules and timers. **Not rerun on 1.0.1:** regen, feeding, rod, tankard, burst, map chips, sleep and wave checks.

## Claims and evidence

Tiers: S static, H server harness, C real client, SV real client on a dedicated server. Bundle paths are under [`EvidenceBundle/`](EvidenceBundle/README.md). All runtime evidence is one Steam account on one machine.

| Claim | Version | Evidence and type | Conditions | Establishes | Does not establish |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0.1 loads, joins and rejoins cleanly | 1.0.1 | M32; `results/acceptance-1.0.1-final.txt`; SV runtime | No test plugins, disposable world, one client | 0 failed plugins, 0 exceptions, 0 HarmonyX warnings in that run | Function of each module; other worlds; length of play |
| The corrected Gale profile loads, joins and rejoins cleanly | 1.0.1 | M37; `results/acceptance-gale-final.txt`, `results/pack-inventory.tsv`; SV runtime | No test plugins, disposable world, one client | Same clean result on the Gale-recorded pack; hashes match on client, server and allow-list; GUIDs unique | Function of each module; the three offered upstream updates |
| ValheimCuisine's rebuild removed 11 conversions | 1.0.0 | M30; `results/fdcheck-1.0.0-*.txt`; SV runtime with probes | Disposable, probes on client and server | Counts fell 12/23/32/46 → 10/20/31/41, caller `ValheimCuisinePlugin.Update` | Exact trigger of Cuisine's reload flag; other mods' stations |
| `CuisineConversions` keeps them | 1.0.1 | M31; `results/fdcheck-1.0.1-*.txt`; SV runtime | As above | Counts hold across rebuilds and rejoin; rules correct on both sides; iron station allows the raw meats | **A finished cook.** Duplicates appear for about 30 s on rejoin, effect unmeasured |
| Disputed foods get correct timers and expire | 1.0.1 | M31; same files | `spawn`, then probe `pickall`; expiry by `skiptime` | Rule, timer, persistence through save and rejoin, rot item | Normal-play expiry; existing saves |
| FineDining processes timers on the owning peer | 1.0.1 | M31 counts plus decompiled `DecayRuntime`; `[code]` | 0 server writes in three runs | Matches the code | A live server-owned container |
| Feeding and merges work with native integration | Pre-1.0.1 | M2, M3, M8, M16; C and SV runtime | Probe-spawned barrels and animals | Dispense, consume, merge rules | Rerun on 1.0.1; two peers |
| Regen fix restores `AddHealthRegen` once | Pre-1.0.1 | F2, M5, M16; C runtime | Real rolled helmet | +3.0 and +1.4 applied once | Gear under Cold with the fix; legendaries |
| Sleep protections work under SeneaL UI | Pre-1.0.1 | M12, M13, M16; SV runtime | **One client, simulated sleepers**, BetterSleepBruh test mode | Crop, pickable, mead, oven, smelter near 1× | Real sleepers, handoff between peers |
| Boosted waves reduced | Pre-1.0.1 | M17; raw CSV local only; SV runtime | One boat, simulated sleepers | 3.29× → 1.16× at world 4.08× | **Normalized waves.** A step remains at boost end, and a 1% hull loss nearby is unattributed |
| Boat protected during a boost | Pre-1.0.1 | M13; SV runtime | Unmatched boarding: user in one run, probe in the other | 85.1→54.6% against 85.1→85.1% | A controlled comparison |
| PlanBuild caused the rejoin NRE, not blueprints | Pre-1.0.1 | M14, M15; SV runtime | Cases A, B, C on disposable data | Identical failure without blueprints; clean after removal | All PlanBuild-dependent content |
| Portal snapshot recovers after rejection | 1.0.0 | M28; SV runtime | 3 of 3 instrumented joins | Recovery about 30 s later | **A populated catalog.** Both worlds had 0 entries |
| `SeekerBrood` page drop restored | 1.0.0 | M28; SV runtime | 20,000 rolls on a live creature | 0.505% against 0.5% target | **Real kills**; starred scaling |
| Missing prefabs stay dormant | Pre-1.0.1 | M25; copy of `Wraeclast` | 3 of 12 objects visited | Unchanged after save and reload on a dedicated server | Client-hosted worlds, where vanilla may delete them |
| Release contains no test code | 1.0.1 | M32; metadata scan | Compile inputs, 190 strings, method names | No probe terms found | That a pattern scan is exhaustive |
| Save interval is 15 minutes | Original world | Store snapshot cadence; `[checked]` | Timestamps only | Cadence of snapshots | **The launch argument.** Its source log was not recovered |
| Shutdown saves gracefully | Pre-1.0.1 | M18; `results/graceful-shutdown.txt` | Disposable, close request | World and store saved, exit 5 s | BakaLoader's stop on the real server; `baka_save` does not work |

## Known weaknesses

- **A clean log proved nothing here.** The worst defect, lost conversions, logged no warning through two "clean" acceptances. Passing acceptance is weak evidence of function.
- The original agent wrote the code, tests and reports. Evidence depends on its probes, which are in `EvidenceBundle/harness/`.
- `ClientProbe` set up scenes and spawned items in many tests. Its `Resolve` calls can trigger a lazy cache build.
- Timing-dependent input automation failed several times; invalid runs are recorded in EVIDENCE.
- Memory headroom fell to 597 MB at an incomplete sample. A later full timeline held 3.3 GB, and the cause of the difference is unknown. See [memory](Operations/OPS-memory.md).

## Tests that could falsify these conclusions

| Test | Would show |
|---|---|
| Cook `BearSteak_TW` at an iron station on 1.0.1 | Whether the fix works end to end |
| Rerun regen, feeding, rod, tankard, burst and chips on 1.0.1 | Regression from the new module or load order |
| Remove Cuisine; check counts and rules | Whether the cause is correctly attributed |
| Two real clients sleeping, with ownership handoff | Whether the sleep protections hold at all between peers |
| Join a world with public portals during the race | Whether a populated catalog recovers |
| Kill `SeekerBrood` many times | Whether real death uses the same path |
| Host `Wraeclast` copy from a client | Whether dormant objects are deleted |
| Change EpicLoot's `AutoStackItems` prefix | Whether `ItemDataStack` really declines safely |
| A long session with several players | Memory, and anything short tests miss |

## Open items and accepted limits

- **Two-peer testing:** unavailable, as only one Steam account exists. Simulated sleepers and one-client ownership changes are not two-peer evidence.
- **Original world:** `Wraeclast` has not run on this code. Tests used disposable data or copies, and originals were hashed before and after.
- **Cooking:** no finished cook on 1.0.1.
- **Waves:** improved, not normalized.
- **Unexplained:** what destroys `PT_BlueRunePebble`; five report-file differences; a station instance showing 24 conversions against the prefab's 23.
- **Location data:** disabled, with intent undecided. See [record](Investigations/INV-location-data.md).
- **Full list:** [remaining work](Operations/OPS-remaining-work.md).

## Reproducibility

**Exercised so far (M35):** fresh clones in a temporary folder, on the original Windows machine, with its Python, .NET SDK, git settings and real Valheim and mod assemblies. Levels 1 and 2 passed there. **No other machine or operating system has been tried**, and Level 3 was not exercised as a reviewer workflow.

| Level | Needs | What you can do |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Clean clone** | Python 3 | `python tools/validate.py`, `python tools/make_evidence_bundle.py --verify`, read everything here |
| **2. Build** | .NET SDK, PowerShell 7, your own legally obtained Valheim and the mods | Build the source; compare with `tools/il-digest.ps1`. See the [source README](https://github.com/ave-satanas/PoVPlus.Compat) |
| **3. Runtime** | Valheim on Steam, the 87-mod pack at the versions in [inventory](Mods/MOD-inventory.md), a dedicated server | Rerun checks. `EvidenceBundle/harness/` shows how; adapt paths and UI coordinates, which assume 2560×1440 |
| **4. Historical only** | Cannot be reproduced from here | Raw logs, saves, screenshots, `Wraeclast`, and runs on the original machine |

Level 2's digest should match only with the same referenced assemblies and a similar compiler: SDK 10.0.100 was used. A mismatch needs investigating, but does not prove different source.

The pack itself is not distributed here. Rebuilding it needs the versions in the inventory from their own sources, plus `EvidenceBundle/config-1.0.1/`. That snapshot omits files listed in the bundle README, so a rebuilt pack is an approximation of the tested environment. Differences between client and server configs are in the [reconciliation record](Investigations/INV-config-reconciliation.md).
