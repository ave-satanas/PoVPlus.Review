# ObjectDB null item

**Trigger:** the **second** return to the main menu, not a plain rejoin. An earlier ledger said "rejoin only", which was imprecise. `[runtime]` M28

**Identity:** `PT_BlueRunePebble`, index 3599 of 3785. Jotunn warns and PoV removes the entry. It is back in ObjectDB, the item list and the scene on the next join, total 3,785. `[runtime]` M28, three joins, twice.

**Unknown:** what destroys the prefab. Its `recipes=0` reading was not compared with a first join.
